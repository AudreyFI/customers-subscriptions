## Description

This project is used to maintain customer's subscriptions and notify them when their subscription expires (15 days, the exact day and 15 days after). This project provides also a frontend application to manage the customers and subscriptions.

Docker, Node.js, Express, Sequelize and React.js as the main technologies.
The subscription state machine is tested with Jest.

## Architecture

- A Postgres Database that contains 4 tables : customer, subscription, customer_subscription and user
- An Express api that will be accessed by a frontend application and by a cron job to manage the validity of the subscriptions (changing status and sending notifications to the customers)
- A frontend application in React to manage the customers and display the subscriptions status to the administrator

These 3 layers will be containerized (Docker) and deployed via Github Actions to an EC2.

We'll use a dns and a reverse proxy to acces the frontend via HTTPS.

## Installation

You'll need to install Docker to launch this project locally

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Build

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod . -t customers-subscriptions
docker build -f Dockerfile.db . -t postgres
```

## Database backup and restore

A docker container named `backup` is doing backups everydays and writes a file here /backup/dump.sql. To restore the database :

```bash
docker cp backup/2024-07-14-15-03-39.dump db:test.dump
docker exec -it db bash -c 'pg_restore -c --user <USER> --dbname <DBNAME> /test.dump'
```
